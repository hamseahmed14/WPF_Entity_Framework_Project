# Project Description

The application is a Covid-19 friendly library system. The purpose of this application is so that a library can limit the amount of visitors to the facility while still offering the basic library features. The members of the library that have an account registered will be able to loan books from the library. The members will be able to browse through the catalogue of books available and are able to put in loan requests. 

The admin can add , remove and update books on the application. Furthermore the admin can accept loan requests from members and can either allow or deny the requests.  The admin will also be able to update members and remove those who have broken the library policy.
