# Project Description

The application is a Covid-19 friendly library system. The purpose of this application is so that a library can limit the amount of visitors to the facility while still offering the basic library features. The members of the library that have an account registered will be able to loan books from the library. The members will be able to browse through the catalogue of books available and are able to put in loan requests. 

The admin can add , remove and update books on the application. Furthermore the admin can accept loan requests from members and can either allow or deny the requests.  The admin will also be able to update members and remove those who have broken the library policy.

###### Sprint review

In this sprint all the user stories have been completed .

###### Sprint Retrospective

The sprint had a big workload, but I have managed to complete all the user stories and side tasks. This sprint has given me enough info on how big the workload should be for the sprints to come. 

Next time I will give myself enough time so that I don't need to under pressure when it is not needed.

###### Sprint Review

Not all user stories have been competed in sprint 2. The user stories that are still being worked on is User Story 2.1 and to be specific task 2.1.1 which is populating the book table in the database.

###### Sprint Retrospective

At the start of the sprint everything went well with no major blocks, but during the testing of a query I soon realised that the database was incorrectly designed. This led to a lot of time being wasted trying to fix it and not completing the sprint on time. 

Next time I would like to plan the sprints properly so that their are no unexpected blocks.



### Sprint 3

###### Sprint Review

All the user stories have been completed for sprint 3. Search and Filter functions have been added to the Book page. The users can use this to search through the catalogue of books. 

###### Sprint Retrospective

In terms of time management sprint 3 went better than sprint 2. This is because the most difficult parts of the project has been completed in sprint 1 and 2. Although I've managed to complete all the user stories, some refactoring is needed when the time is available. 

Next time I would like to spend more time on making the quality of code good and DRY.
